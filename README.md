# bomblab16
This are the files I was provided for my Bomb Lab for the Computer Architecture course at Rutgers University-New Brunswick (01:198:211)

The way I tackled the bomb was:

Phases 1-7:
Tackle the pushes and compares added towards the near/end before the final comparisons and whatnot. Usually, those pushed items are the answers that are being compared.
If it's a string, check that both strings (parsed in argument and the desired argument) are the same.

Phases 8-9:
Map it out, try to find what you're working with and make sure you utilize x/d,x/s,x/3x,etc. to check what it may be.
